    "\n",
    "Is it Yet Another Language ? No, this is, in my opinion, the most important programming language you should masterize before the end of your cursus. In the last (two) decade(s), `Python` became one of the most popular/used language in data science and in particular in astronomy. The reasons for this are rooted in several of the advantages of `Python`:\n",
    "- Readability\n",
    "- Flexibility\n",
    "- High-level language\n",
    "- Robust methods for binding with `C`, `C++` and `FORTRAN` libraries (speed, legacy)\n",
    "- Growing number of libraries (coordinated by a very active community) and modules dedicated to specific scientific problems\n",
    "- You can use basically one single scripting language for every task you may need to do in astronomy. \n",
    "- Data reduction for a growing number of space observatories are running in python. This is the case for ALMA ([CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) environment calls C/C++ programs within ipython), JWST (not yet launched but [data reduction tools](https://jwst.stsci.edu/observing-programs/data-analysis-toolbox) are develloped in python), `HST`, `Chandra` (there is `CIAO` modules for python), ... and many others. All the data reduction developped within iraf are available through `pyraf`. The only noticable exception remains `ESO` data reduction tools ... but `python` still allows you to analyze the data. So most of the time, you can *reduce* and *analyse* your data within the same environment ! You may even be able, some times, to query them through `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not yet convinced, I encourage you to have a look to this Nature paper (Nature 518, 7537) by J.M. Perkel http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20150206  \n",
    "The following quote from this paper summarizes what I have just said before: \n",
    "> \" With the explosive growth of 'big data' in disciplines such as bioinformatics, neuroscience and astronomy, programming know-how is becoming ever more crucial. Researchers who can write code in Python can deftly manage their data sets, and work much more efficiently on a whole host of research-related tasks — from crunching numbers to cleaning up, analysing and visualizing data. Whereas some programming languages, such as MATLAB and R, focus on mathematical and statistical operations, Python is a general-purpose language, along the lines of C and C++ (the languages in which much commercial software and operating systems are written). As such, it is perhaps more complicated, Brown says, but also more capable: it is amenable to everything from automating small sets of instructions, to building websites, to fully fledged applications.\""

Guido van Rossum worked at that time in a project called Amoeba, a distributed operating system. He programmed in a language called ABC but was not fully happy with that language. \n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean? Programming languages are generally categorized in two classes: *compiled* and *interpreted*. `python` may be seen as an *interpreted* language (although at some level it is *compiled*). One speaks of **compiled** language when a code is executed natively through the operating system after an operation, called *compilation* that converts the original code into a code natively understandable by the machine. *Instead*, when the code is evaluated line by line through another program (which is NOT the OS) which handles its execution (in principle this execution is done in a language natively understood by the machine, also called *low-level* language) via *interpretation*, one speaks of an **interpreted** language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important ? Although a given language often exists in different flavours/implementations that are either interpreted or compiled, the difference has an impact on the language properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of interpreted language:\n",
    "1. platform independence (you can easily transport a code from one machine to another\n",
    "2. dynamic typing / flexibility (you do not have to do \"compile/recompile/test/recompile\" all the time !; you can run individual commands without writing a full script.)\n",
    "3. ease of debugging (it is easier to get source code information in interpreted languages)\n",
    "4. small program size (since interpreted languages have flexibility to choose instruction code)\n",
    "5. automatic memory management    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of interpreted language: \n",
    "1. Speed\n",
    "2. Speed\n",
    "3. Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is effectively a (very) high-level language, which means that there is *a lot* of built-in data-types (and we will spend most of the remaining of this class to go though the most important ones: arrays, dictionnary, lists). This variety of data types is part of the reason why python became so popular as it can deal easily with many different kind of input/outputs. \n",

    "We have two ways to run python, either interactively, or from scripts. *Interactive* use is favoured when you want to do small exploratory analysis, test part of codes, visualise some results, while scripts will be used in general to run (and re-run) more complex programs. For now, we will only use *interactive* mode, within `jupyter notebooks`. An overview of other ways for using python is outlined in this [Notebook](Scripts_IDEs_and_Jupyter.ipynb).     "

The most common escape sequences are `\"\\n\"` (adds a new line at the end of the string), `\"\\t\"` (adds a tab), `\"\\b\"` (Backspace). Note that typing in an interactive shell `Hello \\n`, or print r`Hello \\n` wont' have the same effect. When `r` or `R` is preceding the string, the backslash is left in the string.

    "Based on http://www.ster.kuleuven.be/~pieterd/python/html/pure_python/control_flow.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7.1 if statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for an if-statement is the following:\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    # do something else\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # do yet something else\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is no statement to end the `if` statement. Beware of the presence of a colon (:) after each control flow statement. Python relies on indentation and colons to determine whether it is in a specific block of code. For example, in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if a == 1:\n",
    "    print(\"a is 1, changing to 2\")\n",
    "    a = 2\n",
    "print(\"finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first print statement, and the `a = 2` statement only get executed if a is 1. On the other hand, `print(\"finished\")` gets executed regardless, once Python exits the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions in the statements can be anything that returns a boolean value. For example, `a == 1`, `b != 4`, and `c <= 5` are valid conditions because they return either `True` or `False` depending on whether the statements are true or not. Standard comparisons can be used (`==` for equal, `!=` for not equal, `<=` for less or equal, `>=` for greater or equal, `<` for less than, and `>` for greater than), as well as logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). Parentheses can be used to isolate different parts of conditions, to make clear in what order the comparisons should be executed, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if (a == 1 and b <= 3) or c > 3:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, any function or expression that ultimately returns `True` or `False` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with comparisons, another commonly-used operator is `in`. This is used to test whether an item is contained in any collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3]   \n",
    "2 in b   \n",
    "    Out: True   \n",
    "5 in b   \n",
    "    Out: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `b` is a dictionary , this tests that the item is a key of `b`."

    "**Note:** `and`, `or` are boolean operators. `&`, `|` are the equivalent bitwise operator. The difference is that boolean operators are used on boolean values (i.e. the two expression that are compared should be boolean) while `&` and `|` are generally used on integer values (they just compare the bits and so work at a low level). This means that: boolean operators evaluate the first operand for its truth value, and depending on that value, either evaluate and return the second argument, or don't evaluate the second argument and return the first. In other words, the `and` operator works like: ``` x and y => if x is false, then x, else y ```  \n",

    "- The main variable types (`int`, `float`, `string`, `complex`), but also the `None` keyword (the unique member of the type `NoneType`) \n",

    "- The importance of indentation in writing code, especially when defining a `function`, create `loops`, set `conditions`. \n",
    "- We have seen that there is in general no need to pre-declare a variable, nor its type. However, one should be careful that *numbers not followed by a .* are interpreted as integers, but are float otherwise. This can generate bugs as the division of 2 integers is an integer (in python 2.7, not for version > 3). \n",
