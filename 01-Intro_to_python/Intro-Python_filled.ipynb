    "Is it Yet Another Language ? No, this is, in my opinion, the most important programming language you should masterize before the end of your cursus. In the last (two) decade(s), `Python` became one of the most popular/used language in data science and in particular in astronomy. The reasons for this are rooted in several of the advantages of `Python`:\n",
    "- Readability\n",
    "- Flexibility\n",
    "- High-level language\n",
    "- Robust methods for binding with `C`, `C++` and `FORTRAN` libraries (speed, legacy)\n",
    "- Growing number of libraries (coordinated by a very active community) and modules dedicated to specific scientific problems\n",
    "- You can use basically one single scripting language for every task you may need to do in astronomy. \n",
    "- Data reduction for a growing number of space observatories are running in python. This is the case for ALMA ([CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) environment calls C/C++ programs within ipython), JWST (not yet launched but [data reduction tools](https://jwst.stsci.edu/observing-programs/data-analysis-toolbox) are develloped in python), `HST`, `Chandra` (there is `CIAO` modules for python), ... and many others. All the data reduction developped within iraf are available through `pyraf`. The only noticable exception remains `ESO` data reduction tools ... but `python` still allows you to analyze the data. So most of the time, you can *reduce* and *analyse* your data within the same environment ! You may even be able, some times, to query them through `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not yet convinced, I encourage you to have a look to this Nature paper (Nature 518, 7537) by J.M. Perkel http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20150206  \n",
    "The following quote from this paper summarizes what I have just said before: \n",
    "> \" With the explosive growth of 'big data' in disciplines such as bioinformatics, neuroscience and astronomy, programming know-how is becoming ever more crucial. Researchers who can write code in Python can deftly manage their data sets, and work much more efficiently on a whole host of research-related tasks â€” from crunching numbers to cleaning up, analysing and visualizing data. Whereas some programming languages, such as MATLAB and R, focus on mathematical and statistical operations, Python is a general-purpose language, along the lines of C and C++ (the languages in which much commercial software and operating systems are written). As such, it is perhaps more complicated, Brown says, but also more capable: it is amenable to everything from automating small sets of instructions, to building websites, to fully fledged applications.\""

    "The inventor of this language is the Dutch programer Guido Van Rossum. It was conceptualized in the late 1980s. Guido van Rossum worked at that time in a project called Amoeba, a distributed operating system. He programmed in a language called ABC but was not fully happy with that language. \n",
    "In an interview with Bill Venners (January 2003 ; http://www.python-course.eu/history_and_philosophy.php), Guido van Rossum said: \n",
    "> \"I remembered all my experience and some of my frustration with ABC. I decided to try to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC's better properties, but without its problems. So I started typing. I created a simple virtual machine, a simple parser, and a simple runtime. I made my own version of the various ABC parts that I liked. I created a basic syntax, used indentation for statement grouping instead of curly braces or begin-end blocks, and developed a small number of powerful data types: a hash table ( or dictionary, as we call it), a list, strings, and numbers. \" \n",
    "\n",
    "... and as explained in another interview, this started as an holiday occupation. In 1996, Van Rossum said ( https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/ ): \n",
    "> Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a \"hobby\" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).\n",
    "\n",
    "(BTW, imagine the same quote simply between \" \" ... would it be so easy to read ! Identation is one of the things that makes of python a readable langue.) \n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.3 What is an interpreted language ? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"IIIc\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are generally categorized in two classes: *compiled* and *interpreted*. `python` may be seen as an *interpreted* language (although at some level it is *compiled*). One speaks of **compiled** language when a code is executed natively through the operating system after an operation, called *compilation* that converts the original code into a code natively understandable by the machine. *Instead*, when the code is evaluated line by line through another program (which is NOT the OS) which handles its execution (in principle this execution is done in a language natively understood by the machine, also called *low-level* language) via *interpretation*, one speaks of an **interpreted** language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Although a given language often exists in different flavours/implementations that are either interpreted or compiled, the difference has an impact on the language properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of interpreted language:\n",
    "1. platform independence (you can easily transport a code from one machine to another)\n",
    "2. dynamic typing / flexibility (you do not have to do \"compile/recompile/test/recompile\" all the time !; you can run individual commands without writing a full script.)\n",
    "3. ease of debugging (it is easier to get source code information in interpreted languages)\n",
    "4. small program size (since interpreted languages have flexibility to choose instruction code)\n",
    "5. automatic memory management    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of interpreted language: \n",
    "1. Speed\n",
    "2. Speed\n",
    "3. Speed\n",

    "`Python` is effectively a (very) high-level language, which means that there is *a lot* of built-in data-types (and we will spend most of the remaining of this class to go though the most important ones: arrays, dictionnary, lists). This variety of data types is part of the reason why python became so popular as it can deal easily with many different kind of input/outputs. \n",

    "We have two ways to run python, either interactively, or from scripts. *Interactive* use is favoured when you want to do small exploratory analysis, test part of codes, visualise some results, while scripts will be used in general to run (and re-run) more complex programs.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To run Python code interactively, one can use the standard Python prompt, which can be launched by typing `python` in a terminal. Instead, one can use a feature enhanced prompt, `ipython`, where \"i\" stands for interactive (which also means that IPython is an *interpreter*). This is an add-on package that adds many features to the default Python shell, including the ability to edit and navigate the history of previous commands, as well as the ability to tab-complete variable and function names. You can also write several commands one after the other before executing them by typing `Ctrl Enter` between each command instead of `Enter`. For some versions of ipython, this is rather `Ctrl o`. `IPython` allows you also to use any shell command by preceding it with a `!` as we did at the beginning of this Notebook (If this does not work, try without the `!`). This is basically telling Ipython that this shell is activated in the *code* cells of this Jupyter Notebook.    \n",
    "     \n",
    "Once you have launched `ipython`, you can proceed as follows to type your first `python` commands: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "x\n",
    "\n",
    "Out[1]: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "     \n",
    "As you can see in that example, in python you can define variable \"*on the fly*\", there is in general no need to declare a variable and its type before using it. We'll come back to this later in the course. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note:** Depending of how/which version of python has been installed (syntax differs between python 2.7 and python 3.6), you may run ipython with command `ipython2` or `ipython3` (or `ipython` the latter being linked to either `ipython2` or `ipython3`). "

    "\n",
    "Another common built-in `Python` object is the **dictionary**. The dictionnary stores unordered sequence(s) of key-value pairs. It is defined using curly brackets `{ }`, and like lists allows mixing of types. It is a bit like a `list` for which each element has a label such that you can access this element by its label instead of accessing it by its position.    \n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "D = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': L}  # L is a list as defined above\n",
    "D['two']\n",
    "    Out:  2\n",
    "D = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3, four=L)  # Another way to create a dictionary \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are often found as input/outputs of built-in or contributed functions. They work in fact behind the scene when you define new variables that you use within an `ipython` or `juPyter` session. You may have a look behind the curtain by calling `globals()` in the code-cell below. \n",

    "### 1.6 Functions:    <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"IIIf\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen the first bricks of python coding, but once it is necessary to automate some task, it becomes convenient to define **functions**. A function is a kind of \"mini-script\" that can accept (optionally) one or several parameters. Here is how you define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def moffat1D(r, I, alpha, beta):\n",
    "    arg = (r / alpha)**2 + 1\n",
    "    y = I / arg**(beta)\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns the value of a Moffat profile/function at position `r`:   \n",
    "$ y = I_0  \\left( \\left ( \\frac{r}{\\alpha} \\right )^2 +1 \\right)^{-\\beta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This Moffat profile is characterized by the parameters `I`, a normalization factor, `alpha`, the width of the moffat, or rather a scale parameter, and `beta`, a parameter governing the shape of the profile. When $\\beta = 1$, the Moffat profile is identical to a Lorentz \"profile\".    \n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics of functions are:\n",
    "- They start with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name\n",
    "- The argument of the function is in parentheses \n",
    "- After the parentheses, starts a colon `:` which marks the beginning of the code block corresponding to your operation. \n",
    "- The code block associated with the function is **indentated** w.r.t. the main text. This is a *very important* property the python language: indentation (with tabulation or 4-spaces -4-spaces are officially recommended by many python-friendly editors convert your tab into space within your code.) are part of the code, they help legibility BUT not only. They tell the code that something special is happening. \n",
    "- In the above code, a **local variable** (you won't have access to it outside your function) `arg` has been defined\n",
    "- The function ends when new code is NOT indented or when a `return` statement is encountered.\n",
    "- There are some rules regarding function arguments:\n",
    "    * First argument(s) of a function should be mandatory arguments, with no default value. \n",
    "    * Next argument(s) are optional arguments for which you give default values\n",
    "    * You cannot put an argument without default value *after* one with a default value. \n",
    "    * Arguments without default value are positional ones, so if you define `def f(a):`, you do no have to specify the keyword of the function when giving it a value. i.e. `f(0)` will evaluate the function at 0, but `f(a=0)` will also work. On the other hand `f(0, a=0)` will return an Error !\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- `Python` has many built-in functions (some are called methods when they are defined in some objects-classes). For example, the function `range(5)` returns a sequential list of integers.\n",
    "- Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively. \n",
    "- When a final formal parameter of the form `**name` (often `**kwargs` is used) is present, it receives a dictionary containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form `*name` (`*args`) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (`*name` must occur before `**name`.) You may have a look [here](https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/) for more detailed explanations "

    "#### 1.6.1 Functions and docstrings \n",
    "\n",
    "A **very useful** functionality of python is the ability to write, together with your function a simple `help` / basic documentation. For this, you simply have to start the \"help\"-block with triple-quotes (i.e. `\"\"\"`) and end it similarly (This `help()` block needs to be indentated). In python jargon, this help block is effectively called a `Docstring`. This `Docstring` can be called in interactive mode (`help(myfunction)`) will return the information present in that Doctring. *Within Jupyter notebooks*, you can use the combination of keys `Shift + Tab` when your cursor is positioned just after the opening parenthese, to see the help in a small *pop-up window* (repeat `Shift+Tab` for different options). Because `Docstring` are used to design the `help`, it means that it is better to follow some rules when writing them. Unfortunately, those rules are not universal.

Therefore, the [Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is probably a good way to get recommendations on *good practices* for programming in `Python`. We'll try to get used to some of them, but we cannot afford spending too much time on this topic. As you may be encouraged to release your code with your scientific results, or may want to release a public code in the future, I encourage you to read such a document before doing any serious programming.

    "\n",
    "*This section is optional for a first contact with python*    \n",
    "Sometimes, when you look at a function definition in Python, you might see that it takes two strange arguments: `*args` and `**kwargs`. What is this ? `*args` and `**kwargs` allow you to pass multiple arguments or keyword arguments to a function. `*args` is a way to accept positional arguments to a function without defining them.     \n",
    "Example: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def line(x, a, b):\n",
    "    y = a * x + b \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "instead, you can do: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def line(x, *args):\n",
    "    a, b = args \n",
    "    y = a * x + b \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`*` is an unpacking operator. Note that the (iterable) object you build with this operator (i.e.`*args` is a new object) is a tuple, not a list. This also means that you can access arguments of a function using `*args` instead of explicitly listing your parameters but remember that order is crucial !  \n",
    "\n",
    "`**kwargs` works just like `*args`, but instead of accepting *positional arguments* it accepts *keyword* arguments. What is important here is the unpacking operator `**`. You can see it as unpacking twice the entries: first creating a tuple of names, second a tuple of values, and associating them by pairs. This is basically what does a dictionary, and the object created by the `**` operator is effectively a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def line(x, a, b):\n",
    "    y = a * x + b \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "kwargs = {'a':1, 'b': 0.5, 'x':1}\n",
    "line(**kwargs) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that it is not necessary to write `*args` or `**kwargs`. Only the `*` (aesteric) is necessary. You could have also written `*var` and `**var`. This also means that if you have, for your function, an explicit definition of parameters, you can also access them using the `*` or `**` operators. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.7.1 if statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for an if-statement is the following:\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    # do something else\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # do yet something else\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is no statement to end the `if` statement. Beware of the presence of a colon (:) after each control flow statement. Python relies on indentation and colons to determine whether it is in a specific block of code. For example, in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "if a == 1:\n",
    "    print(\"a is 1, changing to 2\")\n",
    "    a = 2\n",
    "print(\"finished\")\n",

    "\n",
    "The first print statement, and the `a = 2` statement only get executed if a is 1. On the other hand, `print(\"finished\")` gets executed regardless, once Python exits the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions in the statements can be anything that returns a boolean value. For example, `a == 1`, `b != 4`, and `c <= 5` are valid conditions because they return either `True` or `False` depending on whether the statements are true or not. Standard comparisons can be used (`==` for equal, `!=` for not equal, `<=` for less or equal, `>=` for greater or equal, `<` for less than, and `>` for greater than), as well as logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). Parentheses can be used to isolate different parts of conditions, to make clear in what order the comparisons should be executed, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if (a == 1 and b <= 3) or c > 3:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, any function or expression that ultimately returns `True` or `False` can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with comparisons, another commonly-used operator is `in`. This is used to test whether an item is contained in any collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3]   \n",
    "2 in b   \n",

This means that: boolean operators evaluate the first operand for its truth value, and depending on that value, either evaluate and return the second argument, or don't evaluate the second argument and return the first. In other words, the `and` operator works like: ``` x and y => if x is false, then x, else y ```  \n",

    "- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "- 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "- Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "- Use docstrings.\n",
    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.\n",
    "- Donâ€™t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Plain ASCII works best in any case."

    "We have seen that `python` is a multi-paradigm language, namely both *interpreted* and *compiled*. This is the reason why it is very versatile, portable and powerful.  \n",
    "We have learned about: \n",
    "- the main built-in structures: `list`, `tuple`, `dictionary`, `set`\n",
    "- The importance of indentation in writing code, especially when defining a `function`, create `loops`, set `conditions`. \n",
    "- We have seen that there is in general no need to pre-declare a variable, nor its type. However, one should be careful that *numbers not followed by a .* are interpreted as integers, but are float otherwise. This can generate bugs as the division of 2 integers is an integer (in python 2.7, not for version > 3). \n",
    "- We have started to be familiar with slicing through lists, and realise that the *first index* of a sequence is *zero*. \n",
    "- We have seen that it is very easy to add documentation to a function using triple quotes \"\"\"\n",
    "- We have learned how to write `list comprehensions` ( [ x+1 for x in L] ) to increase speed and improve readability. "
