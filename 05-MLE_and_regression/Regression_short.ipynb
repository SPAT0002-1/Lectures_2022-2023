    "We've seen that in frequentist inference, deriving information about a parameter $\\theta$ consists in finding a point estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ of this parameter and possibly drawing confidence intervals for $\\theta$. To ensure that those estimators are the *best* possible estimator, frequentists generally follow a method called Maximum Likelihood analysis. We'll summarize the main ideas behind this approach hereafter. The interested reader may consult the notebook [MLE.ipynb](MLE.ipynb) (and ref. therein) for a more in-depth understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do in that approach is to choose a model $M(\\theta)$ that is supposed to describe the underlying population from which the data are drawn. This allows one to calculate a likelihood and find which values of the parameters maximize it, as explained below. "

    "The maximum likelihood approach consists in reading the likelihood in a different way than usual.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first realise that, at first sight, you may consider the likelihood as being a function of your data. Ineed, if you make a measurement of a random variable and obtain a value $x$, the associated likelihood $L$ can be considered as a function of the data because the value of the likelihood you calculate depends on the data you have obtained. One may however turn this around. You have a set of data in hand, and may wonder: what should be the values of the parameters entering into the likelihood (i.e. in the gaussian case above, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) such that the likelihood is maximum (it is natural to think that your data have nothing peculiar). This means that you effectively reads the likelihoo as a function of the model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the idea behind the **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** is two fold: i) the probability of any given set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is proportional to the probability of observing the data (i.e. the likelihood defined above); ii) the most probable set of values of the parameters (of our model) should also be the one that maximizes the probability of obtaining the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You know how to find the extrema of a function: by searching for which values of their variables (here the parameters of the model), its derivative is equal to 0. Because the likelihood can quickly become very small, one calculates its logarithm and search the maximum of $\\ln{L}$.  The maximum of $\\ln{L}$ (varying the \"parameters\" $\\theta$) is obtained by searching the parameters $\\theta$ that yield:\n",

This is bread and butter of scientific research. If we have a model for the conditional distribution, we can write $y \\, = \\, f(x\\,|\\,{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ where ${{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}$ are the parameters of the model.

    "Because we know that the $\\chi^2$ follows a chi-2 distribution, we can use the CDF of the chi2 distribution to make a statistical statement about the value of the $\\chi^2$ that we have obtained, i.e. what is the probability of getting a  value of $\\chi^2$ larger or equal to the one we have obtained. If we write $x$ the value we obtain and $X$ the random variable for which we now the distribution, it means we search to find $p(X \\leq x)$. Remember that from the CDF, we have  can $p(x \\leq X)$, so this p-value is simply 1-CDF. This p-value is not only used in the context of $\\chi^2$ but in the general context of hypothesis testing. \n",

    "If the p-value is small (typically < 0.05), it means that it is unlikely to get such a large value of the $\\chi^2$. On the contrary, if it is too close to 1, it is also suspicious. It means that the derived $\\chi^2$ is very low and probably much lower than what you would have obtained for a random sample. In both cases, the interpretation strongly relies on the uncertainty $\\sigma$ on your data point. If $\\sigma$ is **over-estimated**, your $\\chi^2$ will be too small (and p-value close to 1). COnversely, if the uncertainties are **under-estimated**, your $\\chi^2$ will be too large (and p-value $< 0.05$). "

    "- A *cross validation* set, that allows you to evaluate cross-validation errors. Because the cross validation was not used to evaluate the parameters, the errors may be larger in case of high bias in the fit. Therefore, the model representing the cross validation is likely to be in practice a better model. \n",

    "When the model is **not** anymore linear *in its parameters*, then there is no direct solution through matrix inversion, and it becomes necessary to use purely numerical method. For frequentists, the strategy generally remains to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation, or equivalently minimizing the *weighted sum of the squared residuals* $\\chi^2 \\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{y_i - f(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2$.   \n",

    "# there is the possibility to constrain the parameters to certain ranges using method = 'trf'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the argument `absolute_sigma=True` is **mandatory** if you want a correct covariance matrix. By default, `curve_fit` considers relative sigma and rescale the sigma by a multicative factor based on the variance of the residuals (see help of `curve_fit` for details). \n",

    "- The likelihood of data, given model parameters, is defined as $L \\equiv P(D \\,|\\, M(\\theta))$. \n",
    "- The point-estimators used in classical (frequentists) are in general estimators that maximize the likelihood, and are therefore called \"Maximum Likelihood Estimators\". \n",
    "- For random variables that follow a normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma)$, the likelihood is given as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L \\equiv p(\\{x_i\\} | \\mu, \\sigma ) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^n (2\\,\\pi)^{n/2}} \\exp \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{-(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\, \\sigma^2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Regression of a model $y(x)$ through data points $D={(x_i, y_i)}$ is generally performed by minimizing a merit function of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\chi^2 \\equiv \\sum \\frac{(y_i - y^{\\rm{mod}}_i)^2}{\\sigma^2_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition we have the following: \n",
    "  - Minimizing the above merit function is called a $\\chi^2$ regression. The $\\chi^2$ merit function follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom, where the number of degrees of freedom is given by the difference between the number of data points and the number of parameters of the model. \n",
    "  - When the uncertainties $\\sigma_i = 1$ for all the data points, one speaks of a \"least-square\" regression. \n",
    "  - One defines the reduced $\\chi^2_{\\rm red} = \\chi^2 / \\nu$. In the case where the model represents well the data , a $\\chi^2_{\\rm red} \\sim 1$ is expected (as $\\nu$ is the expectation value of the chi-2 distribution). \n",
    "  - The quality of the regression can be evaluated based on the comparison of the obtained $\\chi^2$ and its expectation value (from the chi-2 distribution). This can be summarized by calculating a p-value which is $p \\equiv 1-\\rm{CDF}(\\rm{chi2}(\\nu))$, where $\\nu$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the chi-2 distribution.  \n",
    "  - The model parameters inferred through a regression, are parameters that maximize the likelihood. \n",
    " \n",
    "- The likelihood for gaussian uncertainties is proportional to $\\exp(-\\chi^2/2)$ \n",
    "- A regression model is said *linear* if it is linear in its model parameters. In this case, there is an exact solution resulting from matrix inversion and multiplications, involving the data and their uncertainties (through a covariance matrix). \n",
    "- A regression model is *not linear* if it is **not** linear in its parameters. In that case, a numerical algorithm is needed to find the best model parameters. \n",
