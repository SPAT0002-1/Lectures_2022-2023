    "We've seen that in frequentist inference, deriving information about a parameter $\\theta$ consists in finding a point estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ of this parameter and possibly drawing confidence intervals for $\\theta$. To ensure that those estimators are the *best* possible estimator, frequentists generally follow a method called Maximum Likelihood analysis. We'll summarize the main ideas behind this approach hereafter. The interested reader may consult the notebook [MLE.ipynb](MLE.ipynb) (and ref. therein) for a more in-depth understanding. \n",

    "The maximum likelihood approach consists in reading the likelihood in a different way than usual.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first realise that, at first sight, you may consider the likelihood as being a function of your data. Indeed, if you make a measurement of a random variable and obtain a value $x$, the associated likelihood $L$ can be considered as a function of the data because the value of the likelihood you calculate depends on the data you have obtained. One may however turn this around. You have a set of data in hand, and may wonder: what should be the values of the parameters entering into the likelihood (i.e. in the gaussian case above, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) such that the likelihood is maximum (it is natural to think that your data have nothing peculiar). This means that you effectively reads the likelihoo as a function of the model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the idea behind the **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** is two fold: i) the probability of any given set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is proportional to the probability of observing the data (i.e. the likelihood defined above); ii) the most probable set of values of the parameters (of our model) should also be the one that maximizes the probability of obtaining the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You know how to find the extrema of a function: by searching for which values of their variables (here the parameters of the model), its derivative is equal to 0. Because the likelihood can quickly become very small, one calculates its logarithm and search the maximum of $\\ln{L}$.  The maximum of $\\ln{L}$ (varying the \"parameters\" $\\theta$) is obtained by searching the parameters $\\theta$ that yield:\n",

    "Because we know that the $\\chi^2$ follows a chi-2 distribution, we can use the CDF of the chi2 distribution to make a statistical statement about the value of the $\\chi^2$ that we have obtained, i.e. what is the probability of getting a  value of $\\chi^2$ larger or equal to the one we have obtained. If we write $x$ the value we obtain and $X$ the random variable for which we now the distribution, it means we search to find $p(X \\leq x)$. Remember that from the CDF, we have  can $p(x \\leq X)$, so this p-value is simply 1-CDF. This p-value is not only used in the context of $\\chi^2$ but in the general context of hypothesis testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is small (typically < 0.05), it means that it is unlikely to get such a large value of the $\\chi^2$. On the contrary, if it is too close to 1, it is also suspicious. It means that the derived $\\chi^2$ is very low and probably much lower than what you would have obtained for a random sample. In both cases, the interpretation strongly relies on the uncertainty $\\sigma$ on your data point. If $\\sigma$ is **over-estimated**, your $\\chi^2$ will be too small (and p-value close to 1). COnversely, if the uncertainties are **under-estimated**, your $\\chi^2$ will be too large (and p-value $< 0.05$). "

In such cases, one apply a penalty to the likelihood function. \n",

    "### IV.3 Regression for non linear models:\n",
    "    \n",
    "When the model is **not** anymore linear *in its parameters*, then there is no direct solution through matrix inversion, and it becomes necessary to use purely numerical method. For frequentists, the strategy generally remains to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation, or equivalently minimizing the *weighted sum of the squared residuals* $\\chi^2 \\equiv\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{y_i - f(x_i)}{\\sigma_i} \\right)^2$.   \n",
    "Note that other merit function can be implemented (e.g. maximum entropy). \n",
    "\n",
    "A popular and efficient algorithm to find the parameters that minimize your $\\chi^2$ merit function is the so-called Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Conceptually, that method switches between the \"Gradient Descent Method\" (you perturb the parameters by some amount \"h\" in the direction of steepest descent in your $\\chi^2$ function), and the \"Gauss-Newton Method\" that assumes that locally your function is quadratic in the parameters to determine \"h\", through a \"lagrange parameter\" lambda that is modified depending of the observed change in merit function. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, you can use the `curve_fit()` function from the `scipy.optimize` to apply levenberg Marquardt to the fit of your function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `curve_fit()` function works like this:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# first create a function that defines your model\n",
    "# It must take the independent variable as the first argument and the parameters to fit as separate remaining arguments.\n",
    "def func(x, p1, p2, p3):\n",
    "    y = f(x, p1, p2, p3)  # replace f(x, p1, p2, p3) by a function of vector x with parameters p1, p2, p3\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "# Second we call curve_fit(), first three arguments being func, xdata, ydata. Next two are optional initial guess and errors on y. \n",
    "pfit, pcov = scipy.optimize.curve_fit(func, xdata, ydata, p0=x0, sigma=sigma, absolute_sigma=True) \n",
    "# there is the possibility to constrain the parameters to certain ranges using method = 'trf'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the argument `absolute_sigma=True` is **mandatory** if you want a correct covariance matrix. By default, `curve_fit` considers relative sigma and rescale the sigma by a multicative factor based on the variance of the residuals (see help of `curve_fit` for details). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** There is currently important development of model fitting within the astropy package. Several of the algorithm used are wrapper on algorithms from other packages (such as `numpy` and `scipy.optimize`), so think also \n",
    "of having a look to `astropy.modeling` (http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/) when you search for implementations of classical fitting algorithm in python. \n",

    "\n",
    "Non linear models are likely to converge towards a local minimum. For that reason it is *very important* to try to guess plausible values of the model parameters beforhand, in other words, you need to make a clever choice of the initial conditions. How can this be done?  \n",
    "A likely possibility is that the parameters of your model can be interpreted \"physically\" (e.g. heating rate of material, period of rotation of an asteroid, period of revolution of a planet around its star, ...). This may help you to pick value that make sense. If this is not possible, or not enough (you know for a few parameters but not all), then you should proceed with method: \n",
    "\n",
    "- (a) Visualise the prediction of the model for various sets of parameters. Try to change them one by one to see how they impact the model, or, if possible grid the parameter space (This is not always tractable if you have many parameters). Compare visually the output of the models to your data. If your model go through your data points, you may hope to have reasonable enough initial conditions. \n",
    "- (b) if you have too many sets of parameters to test, it is then better to simply randomly sample the parameter space and calculate the $\\chi^2$ for each set of random parameters, and subsequently start the fit from the set of parameters yielding the smaller $chi^2$. Visualising the values of the $\\chi^2$ (or the distribution) for the different model parameters may allow you to guess better initial conditions. This approach starts to be close to what is performed in the framework of Bayesian inference. \n",
    "- (c) If the optimization is fast enough, you may consider performing the fit multiple times using either initial conditions from a grid of values, or randomly drawn initial conditions. "

    "The module `statsmodels` (see https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html ) provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests and performing regressions. Once regression is perfomed on data, it also systematically calculates various quantities or performs various tests allowing to quantify the quality of your model(ing). Researchers familiar with `R` will recognise features available when performing statistical analyses with that language. `Pandas dataframes` are the prefered data format but `numpy arrays` can also be used. See also the following webpage http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/statistics/index.html#formulas-to-specify-statistical-models-in-python to understand how data, models, and variables (the `y` variable in `statsmodels` is called *endogenous* while the `x` variable is called *exogenous*) are defined with `statsmodels`. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The likelihood of data, given model parameters, is defined as $L \\equiv P(D \\,|\\, M(\\theta))$. \n",
    "- The point-estimators used in classical (frequentists) are in general estimators that maximize the likelihood, and are therefore called \"Maximum Likelihood Estimators\". \n",
    "- For random variables that follow a normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma)$, the likelihood is given as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L \\equiv p(\\{x_i\\} | \\mu, \\sigma ) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^n (2\\,\\pi)^{n/2}} \\exp \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{-(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\, \\sigma^2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Regression of a model $y(x)$ through data points $D={(x_i, y_i)}$ is generally performed by minimizing a merit function of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\chi^2 \\equiv \\sum \\frac{(y_i - y^{\\rm{mod}}_i)^2}{\\sigma^2_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition we have the following: \n",
    "  - Minimizing the above merit function is called a $\\chi^2$ regression. The $\\chi^2$ merit function follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom, where the number of degrees of freedom is given by the difference between the number of data points and the number of parameters of the model. \n",
    "  - When the uncertainties $\\sigma_i = 1$ for all the data points, one speaks of a \"least-square\" regression. \n",
    "  - One defines the reduced $\\chi^2_{\\rm red} = \\chi^2 / \\nu$. In the case where the model represents well the data , a $\\chi^2_{\\rm red} \\sim 1$ is expected (as $\\nu$ is the expectation value of the chi-2 distribution). \n",
    "  - The quality of the regression can be evaluated based on the comparison of the obtained $\\chi^2$ and its expectation value (from the chi-2 distribution). This can be summarized by calculating a p-value which is $p \\equiv 1-\\rm{CDF}(\\rm{chi2}(\\nu))$, where $\\nu$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the chi-2 distribution.  \n",
    "  - The model parameters inferred through a regression, are parameters that maximize the likelihood. \n",
    " \n",
    "- The likelihood for gaussian uncertainties is proportional to $\\exp(-\\chi^2/2)$ \n",
    "- A regression model is said *linear* if it is linear in its model parameters. In this case, there is an exact solution resulting from matrix inversion and multiplications, involving the data and their uncertainties (through a covariance matrix). \n",
    "- A regression model is *not linear* if it is **not** linear in its parameters. In that case, a numerical algorithm is needed to find the best model parameters. \n",
    "- A non exhaustive list of python tools usable for regression is provided in Sect. [IV.5](#IV.5-Summary-of-python-tools-for-regression)"
