    "In the case of one dimensional distribution, it is pretty easy to generate a mock sample from an arbitrary distribution. This method, also called *transformation method*, makes use of the fact that to a given pdf $f(x)$ is associated a CDF $F(x)$. The CDF, $F(x)$ provides, for each value of $x_i$, the probability that $p(x < x_i)$, and we have $0 < p(x < x_i) < 1$. One can read the CDF the other way around (i.e. take the inverse of the CDF) to generate a random sample from a specific distribution (this is in fact the method used by `scipy.stats.distribution.rvs()` to generate a data sample following a given distribution). For this purpose, one generates a uniform sample of $y$, with $0 < y < 1$, and reads on the corresponding values $x'$. \n",

If `n = scipy.stats.norm(0,1)`, then the mean `mu = n.mean()`, standard deviation `sigma = n.std()`, etc\n",

For this, one uses the *percent point function* `ppf` that is the inverse of the `cdf` and shown how to use it to calculate an interquartile range.
