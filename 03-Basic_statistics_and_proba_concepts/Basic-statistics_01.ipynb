    "- the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is generally called **sample space** and denoted, $\\Omega$. \n",
    "- Points in $\\Omega$, are called **realisations** $\\omega$. \n",
    "- An **Event** is a subset of $\\Omega$ (i.e. a subsample of the $\\omega$).\n",
    "- $p(A)$ is the **probability** of an event A. ($p(A)$ can also refer to a probability that a value of $x$ falls in a d$x$ wide interval around $x$. )\n",

    "**Example**: We measure the magnitude $m$ of a variable star. Then $\\Omega = {\\rm I\\!R}$ (or some plausible range such as $]-30, 40 [ $, but this makes little difference in practice and $\\Omega$ can in general be larger than needed). $\\omega$ is a value in $\\Omega$. While an event is the ensemble of magnitude measurements that are e.g. such that $m_i > 15$ and $m_i <=15.5$, hence this *event* is A = ]15, 15.5].

By definition, the *interquartile range* contains 50% of the surface behind the CDF / PDF and hence 0.5 of the probability (centered on the median). We will see later how to use percentiles to calculate confidence intervals. \n",
