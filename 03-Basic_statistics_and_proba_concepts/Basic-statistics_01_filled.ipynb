    "\n",
    "With this lecture, we aim to give you tools to manipulate data (from observations or from simulations). Data, even when being the outcome of some deterministic process, contain a stochastic component, for example due to the observational device. This means that in essence, data are what statisticians call a **random variable**. This is why, when you report measurements you also need to report some uncertainties. These uncertainty calculation look often to student like some kind of black magic. This also means that they are sometimes not adequately used or reported. We'll clarify in the coming lectures, how to make those calculations using python tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a necessary step to enter into the field of machine learning. If you look on Wikipedia at the page dedicated to [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), you'll find the following definition: \"Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\" This is not the result of black magic, but of well understood statistic and probability.

    "\n",
    "In probability theory, we define the following:\n",
    "- the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is generally called **sample space** and denoted, $\\Omega$. \n",
    "- Points in $\\Omega$, are called **realisations** $\\omega$. In other words each of your *data point* is a realisation (but there may exist other  realisations that are not in your data). \n",
    "- An **Event** is a subset of $\\Omega$ (i.e. a subsample of the $\\omega$). In other words your *data set* is an event.  \n",
    "- $p(A)$ is the **probability** of an event A. ($p(A)$ can also refer to a probability that a value of $x$ falls in a d$x$ wide interval around $x$. )\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *frequentist (classical) interpretation of statistics*: You make a measurement, you repeat it an infinite number of times, and build a histogram. This histogram gives the relative frequency of getting a measurement compared to another. This relative frequency is what we call a probability. The whole possible outcomes of an experiment is called sample space $\\Omega$. An event is a subsample of $\\omega$ / is an ensemble of realisations (your data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: We measure the magnitude $m$ of a variable star. Then $\\Omega = {\\rm I\\!R}$ (or some plausible range such as $]-30, 40 [ $, but this makes little difference in practice and $\\Omega$ can in general be larger than needed). $\\omega$ is a value in $\\Omega$. While an event is the ensemble of magnitude measurements  that are e.g. such that $m_i > 15$ and $m_i <=15.5$, hence this *event* is A = ]15, 15.5]. Note that an event *can* also be a single point (i.e. A = [17.]). \n",

    "> A random variable is a variable whose value results from the measurement of a quantity that is subject to random variations. \n",

    "**Example:** You roll a dice. You can then define $X(\\omega)$ be the *number of times you draw an even number* in a sequence $\\omega$. Imagine you have rolled your dice 10 times, and get  $\\omega = {1, {\\bf 2, 4, 2}, 5, {\\bf 4, 6}, 3, 3, 1 }$. Then $X(\\omega) = 5$ is the value taken by your *random variable* X. \n",

It picks one item at random from an array, and it is equally likely to pick any of the items. The function call is `np.random.choice(array_name)`, where `array_name` is the name of the array from which to make the choice."

A key question is indeed to figure out what is the pdf $h_X(x)$ that is behind a set of random variables (directly observed or predicted by a model fed by some data). I.e. we generally try to answer the question \"From which pdf $h(x)$ are drawn my $x$ ?\". In Bayesian inference, one tries to derive the (posterior) pdf associated to a quantity. Why are we interested by those ? Because they tell us something about the probability of an event/observation to occur or help us to figure out whether a physical model is sensible *given* the observations in hands.  \n",

Since $x$ are generally measured with errors, it may be that $f(x)$ does not tend to $h(x)$ even for an infinite number of measurements (we end up with a \"blurred\" or \"broadened\" version of the pdf). Because $h(x)$ gives the probability that $x$ falls in an (infinitely) small interval $x, x+{\\rm{d}}x$, the pdf is also sometimes written $p(x)$ (cf Chapter 3 of our [reference book](#book)). \n",

In general, we do not know $h(x)$ and we have to guess its functional form. This function form can either be \"parametric\" (e.g. a gaussian) or \"non parametric\" (e.g. a sum of small gaussians that mimic a more complex pdf). "

    "The CDF provides a direct way to calculate the probability for the value of a random variable $X$ to be between 2 values $x_1$ and $x_2$. If $x_1 < x_2$, then $P(x_1 < X < x_2) = H(x_2) - H(x_1)$. On the above figure, this would be the difference of area up to $x_2$ minus the area up to $x_1$.   \n",
