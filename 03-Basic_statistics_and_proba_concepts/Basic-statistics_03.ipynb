    "This notebook first introduces the concept of \"point estimate\" in statistics and explains how the \"standard error on the mean\" is defined. If you think that the uncertainty associated to an ensemble of measurements is given by the standard deviation on those measurements, then you need to carefully practice this notebook. Second, this Notebook addresses the question: How do you proceed to estimate the error on a quantity that is not directly observable (i.e. is a function of variables on which you have an uncertainty estimate). The solution is through the use of Monte-Carlo techniques to estimates uncertainties (we abusively call this error but uncertainty is a more appropriate terminology).   \n",

    "The random variable you are interested in is often a function of other random variables that are directly measured. A simple example in physics is the measurement of the speed of an object. You may not measure the speed directly but the distance and the time. For each time and distance you measure, you estimate have an associated uncertainty. But what you are interested in is the velocity, i.e. distance / unit of time. How do you propagate the two uncertainties to derive the uncertainty on the speed ? We'll see below how to proceed thanks to the **error propagation formula** (this is a formula you should know and apply !). But we'll also introduce a numerical approach (Monte-Carlo technique) to tackle that question. This is particularly useful if you are in a situation where you cannot easily apply the error propagation formula (you need to calculate partial derivatives on random variable), or when you suspect that this formula is not valid (it is an approximate formula). The Monte-Carlo technique is also a powerful way to numerically verify some of the formula we have/will introduced or some well known theorems of statistics.  \n",

    "- when we calculates statistics of a distribution (we call the mean, standard deviation, moment, ... *statistics* of a distribution) based on a sample of data points, we then work with **estimators** of the statistics. \n",
    "- Estimators, as they depend on the sample in hand, are **random varible** and are therefore not known \"perfectly\". There are therefore uncertainties associated to those estimators, and this uncertainty generally depends on the sample size.  \n",
    "- If you have a sample of N data points $x_i$, that their mean is $\\bar{x}$ (that we also write $\\hat{\\mu}$) and standard deviation $s$, then, the uncertainty on the mean is called standard error on the mean (stde) $stde = \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}= \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} $. The standard error on the mean is different from the standard deviation of your sample. \n",
    "- How the distribution of a random variable $X$ is transformed the we consider a function $Y = \\phi(X)$. The change of variable formula is similar to what we use for non random variable.\n",
    "- The **standard error propagation formula** allows us to calculate the uncertainty on a random variable $Z = \\phi(X, Y)$.  We have:     \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_z^2 \\, = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\right)_\\bar{x}^2  \\sigma_x^2 \\, + \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right)_\\bar{y}^2  \\sigma_y^2  + 2  \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\right)_\\bar{x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right)_\\bar{y} \\sigma_{xy}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- The **Monte-Carlo approach** can be used to estimate errors if the standard error propagation formula is suspected not to give reliable results (cf. 1st order truncation of the Taylor expansion). This method is particularly simple to implement in python as `scipy.stats.distribution.rvs()` allows one to draw samples from various univariate distributions. **Monte-Carlo** may also be used to create synthetic data sets that looks like your real data.
